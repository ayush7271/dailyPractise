# Null Object Pattern

The Null Object Pattern is a design pattern 
- that provides a default behavior in cases where an object is expected but none is available. 
- Instead of returning null or throwing an error when an object is missing, this pattern suggests using a “null object” that adheres to the expected interface but does nothing or provides a neutral behavior.

### Null Object Pattern Overview

-	**Purpose**: To eliminate the need for null checks, preventing null or undefined errors in the code.
-	**Structure**: Define a “null object” that has the same interface as the expected object but implements it with neutral or do-nothing behavior.
-	**Real-World Example**: Logging systems where you can use a “null” logger that does nothing if no logging is required.

### Code Example (Null Object Pattern in JavaScript)

```js
// Abstract Notifier class defining the interface
// Defines the interface for all notifiers.
class Notifier {
  send(message) {
    throw new Error("This method should be overridden!");
  }
}

// Concrete Notifier class: EmailNotifier
// Implements the send method to send an email to the user.
class EmailNotifier extends Notifier {
  constructor(userEmail) {
    super();
    this.userEmail = userEmail;
  }

  send(message) {
    console.log(`Sending email to ${this.userEmail}: ${message}`);
  }
}

// Null Object class: NullNotifier
// Does nothing when the send method is called
// Implements the send method as well but does nothing. 
// It provides a neutral response to avoid null checks and prevents errors when the user has opted out of notifications.
class NullNotifier extends Notifier {
  send(message) {
    // Does nothing - acts as a silent placeholder
  }
}

// Usage example
// Returns either an EmailNotifier or a NullNotifier based on the user’s notification preferences.
function getUserNotifier(user) {
  if (user && user.emailNotificationsEnabled) {
    return new EmailNotifier(user.email);
  } else {
    return new NullNotifier(); // Use NullNotifier if notifications are disabled
  }
}

// Usage
const activeUser = { email: "user@example.com", emailNotificationsEnabled: true };
const optedOutUser = { email: "no-reply@example.com", emailNotificationsEnabled: false };

// Get notifier for each user
const activeUserNotifier = getUserNotifier(activeUser);
const optedOutUserNotifier = getUserNotifier(optedOutUser);

// Send notifications
activeUserNotifier.send("Welcome to our service!");
// Output: Sending email to user@example.com: Welcome to our service!

optedOutUserNotifier.send("You have a new message.");
// Output: (No output, as NullNotifier does nothing)
```

### Explanation:

-	Notifier (Abstract Class): Defines the interface for all notifiers.
-	EmailNotifier (Concrete Class): Implements the send method to send an email to the user.
-	NullNotifier (Null Object Class): Implements the send method as well but does nothing. It provides a neutral response to avoid null checks and prevents errors when the user has opted out of notifications.
-	getUserNotifier (Factory Function): Returns either an EmailNotifier or a NullNotifier based on the user’s notification preferences.

### Real-World Scenarios for the Null Object Pattern

#### 1.	Logging Systems:
-	In applications that support different logging levels (e.g., debug, info, error), a NullLogger can be used in place of a real logger when logging is turned off. Instead of checking if logging is enabled each time, the NullLogger simply implements the same methods as the real logger but does nothing.
#### 2.	User Permissions and Access Control:
-	When working with complex access control systems, a NullPermission object can be used to represent a default permission that does nothing. This helps in scenarios where specific permissions are required only for certain users but shouldn’t throw errors for others.
#### 3.	Optional Dependencies:
-	In cases where a class might depend on an optional dependency (such as a caching layer), the NullObject can act as a placeholder. This way, you can use the optional dependency without performing null checks.

### Edge Cases and Considerations

#### 1.	Object Behavior Expectations:
-	Ensure that the NullObject matches the expected interface and behavior of the concrete class. Any missing method or different behavior can lead to unexpected issues in the code that relies on the NullObject.
#### 2.	Silent Failures:
-	Using a null object might hide issues silently. For instance, if a required object is missing, a null object could make it hard to detect errors in logic. It’s essential to use null objects only when the “do nothing” behavior is intentional.
#### 3.	Performance Overhead:
-	In high-performance applications, excessive use of the Null Object Pattern might introduce unnecessary instantiation of neutral objects. If performance is critical, consider lazy loading or other techniques to minimize overhead.
#### 4.	Null Object as Default Parameter:
-	If using this pattern for function parameters, consider setting the null object as a default parameter to simplify usage and prevent passing null or undefined.
