- Short introduction and previous projects
- React Router
- How to prevent unauthorized users from accessing the content of the application? Explain private routing with code implementation.
- Error Boundary - Its uses and how to build an error boundary component. The lifecycle methods used to build the error boundary component.
- There are 3 components Parent1, Child1, and Child2. If an error occurs in Child2, then an error message should be shown for the Child2 component only, and the rest of the components should render as they are without any error message. Similarly, for Child1, the error message will be completely different from Child2. We need to write the code for this using the ErrorBoundary component.
- useEffect and its uses.
- Some programs to check the useEffect concepts like how to make API calls on page load.
- Can we make an API call outside useEffect? What happens if we do so?
- Write a JS program to sum up the digits of a number. For example: 2576 -> 2 + 5 + 7 + 6 -> 20 -> 2 + 0 -> 2 (The interviewer was expecting a one-liner solution for this).
- Write a program to remove everything except even numbers from the array, but you cannot use a new array.  
  Ex: I/p: [1, 2, 3, a, d, f, "#", 4, 6, 4, 4, ")", "("] => [2, 4, 6, 4, 4] (The interviewer was expecting a one-liner solution for this).
- How React works behind the scenes? How does it render the UI? Reconciliation, Virtual DOM, and diffing algorithm.
- Context API and scenario-based question: Create two components - Parent and Child. Parent has a state `num` and Child has a set of buttons to increment and decrement the `num`. You need to make it work without using props. The interviewer wanted me to write down all the React components for this.
- Tell me all the topics you know in React and what all you don't know/are currently learning.
- Implement a counter component (one Parent, two Child components with decrement and increment functions) and optimize it.
- Write code to use React Context API and some follow-up questions.
- Tell me the effects you have used to date. Differences between useCallback and useMemo.
- ES6 features and related concepts.

**Note**: We need to write the programs in Notepad only, and any syntax highlighting editor is not allowed.
