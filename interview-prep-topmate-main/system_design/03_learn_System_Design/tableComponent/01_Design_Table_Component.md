---

- **Focus:** Designing a great, flexible component instead of a complete web application.  
- **Goals:**  
  - Build a component usable across various applications by different teams.  
  - Explore:  
    - Component architecture.  
    - High-level design problems.  
    - Specific features of the component.  
    - Broader topics like **performance** and **accessibility**.  

---

## **UI Component vs. Web Application**  
- **UI Components:**  
  - Smaller in scope, requiring high attention to detail.  
  - Prioritize **developer experience** alongside user experience.  
  - Focus on modularity and reusability.  
  - Delve into:  
    - Component state.  
    - Lifecycle.  
    - Behavior.  

- **Web Applications:**  
  - Prioritize **user experience** for intuitive interfaces.  
  - Consider holistic architecture, including front-end and back-end interactions.  

---
   
## **Questions to Gather Requirements**  
1. **Should we support different types of columns?**  
   - Yes, including customizable cells.  
2. **What data manipulation features are needed?**  
   - Sorting, filtering, pagination, and customizable operations.  
3. **Should it support export and import?**  
   - Yes, **exporting to XLS and CSV** formats.  
4. **Client-side or server-side rendering?**  
   - Focus on **client-side rendering** for simplicity.  
5. **Who is the audience?**  
   - Internal use now, but **open-source plans** for the future.  

---

## **Functional Requirements**  
- **Column Types:**  
  - Default types: Text, number, date, and checkbox.  
- **Data Manipulation:**  
  - Sorting and filtering by parameters.  
  - Pagination support.  
- **Exporting:**  
  - Enable data export to various formats for download.  

---

## **Non-Functional Requirements**  
- **Accessibility:**  
  - Must accommodate users with disabilities.  
- **Flexibility:**  
  - Allow customization to suit diverse teams and companies.  
- **Performance:**  
  - Handle unpredictable usage scenarios across devices.  
- **Localization:**  
  - Support translations into multiple languages.  

---

## **Component Architecture**  
- **Key Parts:**  
  - **View:** Divided into:  
    - **Header:** Includes filters.  
    - **Body:** Displays data in rows and cells.  
    - **Footer:** May include pagination.  
  - **Controller:**  
    - Handles logic, e.g., preparing input data and handling user events.  
  - **No Model:** Data is expected from external sources.  

---

## **Design Considerations**  
- **Two Experiences:**  
  - **User Experience (UX):** For end-users interacting with the UI.  
  - **Developer Experience (DX):** For developers configuring the component.  
- **Customization:**  
  - **Custom Cells:** Allow clients to pass custom components for rendering.  

---


## **Design Goals**  
- **Key Goals:**  
  - High customizability.  
  - Accessibility.  
  - High performance.  
- **Excluded Features:**  
  - All-browser support.  
  - Offline mode.  
  - Mobile adaptation.  

---

## **Distribution Options**  
- **NPM:**  
  - Flexibility for dependency management.  
  - Best for complex applications.  
- **CDN:**  
  - Quick integration via script tags.  
  - Ideal for simple websites.  
- **Recommendation:** Support **both approaches**.  

---

## **Filters and Bookmarks**  
### **Filter Types**  
- **Default Filter:** Value matches the cell.  
- **Checkbox Filter:** True/false selection.  
- **Range Filter:** Two inputs, suitable for dates and numbers.  
- **Multi-Select Filter:** Allows multiple selections.  

### **Bookmarks**  
- **Purpose:** Save specific table view settings (e.g., filters, sorting).  
- **Storage Options:**  
  - **Local Storage:** Persistent but device-specific.  
  - **Database:** Requires client integration.  

---

## **Customization Features**  
- **Resizable Columns:**  
  - Allow users to adjust column widths using drag-and-drop.  
- **Tooltips:**  
  - Shown when column widths are too small.  

---

## **Event Delegation**  
- **Definition:** Use a single handler for multiple elements via a shared ancestor.  
- **Advantages:**  
  - Improves performance.  
  - Simplifies addition/removal of elements.  

---

## **Performance Optimization**  
- **Virtualization:**  
  - Only render visible rows + buffer for smooth scrolling.  
- **Row Buffer:** Configurable for performance tuning.  
- **UI Performance Enhancements:**  
  - Use skeletons with shimmer effects.  
  - Lightweight icons and fonts.  

---



## **General Accessibility**  
- **Resizable Columns:**  
  - Add **ARIA roles** and properties:  
    - `aria-label`, `aria-labeledby`.  
    - `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`.  
- **Focusable Splitters:** Use the `separator` role for enhanced accessibility.  

---


## Semantic Texts and Accessibility

- Use **semantic texts** to enhance clarity and accessibility.  
- **Correct ARIA attributes and roles** should be implemented for all interactive elements.  
- Interactive elements should include **focus** and **hover styles**.  
- Elements without titles (e.g., icon buttons) should have:  
  - `aria-label`  
  - `aria-labelledby`  

- Optional features to consider:  
  - **High contrast themes**  
  - **Right-to-left (RTL) direction** for Arabic and similar languages  

### Grid Component Notes:
- Most text content in the grid is user-provided and does **not require translation**.  
- However, other text such as button labels and ARIA attributes **must be translated**.

---

## Translation and Language Management

- Default language: **English**  
- **General approach:**  
  - Store labels in **separate packages** to avoid loading unnecessary assets.  
  - Load only the required language data (e.g., German) to reduce data size.  

---

##  Security Considerations

### General Security
- While sensitive user data is not handled, **security remains critical**.  
- Be aware of the security rules of applications using the component, e.g., **Content Security Policy (CSP)**.  
- Warn clients about potential impacts of their CSP configurations.  

### Exporting Data
- Risks when exporting to CSV for apps like Excel or Google Sheets:  
  - **Cells starting with certain symbols are treated as formulas.**  
  - Mitigation:  
    - Warn clients to remove or modify these symbols.  
    - Add safeguards to prevent formula execution.  

### Component Safety
- Primary concern: **Execution of malicious code on the page**.  
- **Mitigation:**  
  - Use tools like **SonarQube**:  
    - Tests against standards like **CWE**, **SANS Top 25**, and **OWASP Top 10**.  

---

## Rendering Models and Flexibility

### Default: Client-Side Rendering (CSR)
- All data is downloaded and manipulated on the client side.  
- Advantages:  
  - Simplicity of development  
  - Minimal server load  

- **Disadvantages:**  
  - Inefficient for large data sets or low-performance devices.  
  - Data-heavy operations can slow down user experience.  

---

### Alternative Rendering Models

#### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- Data is manipulated on the **server side**.  
- Benefits:  
  - High performance for large data sets.  
  - Lazy data loading: Users fetch fragments instead of all data at once.  
- **Responsibilities for front-end developers:**  
  - Fetch and display data from the server.  

#### Infinite Row Model
- Similar to SSR but uses **cursor-based pagination** instead of offset-based.  
- **Advantages:**  
  - Avoids processing skipped rows in large datasets.  
  - Prevents inaccurate page windows.  
- **Challenges:**  
  - Harder to implement compared to traditional SSR.
