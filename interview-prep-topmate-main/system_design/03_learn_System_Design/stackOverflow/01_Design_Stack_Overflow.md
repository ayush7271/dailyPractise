### **Introduction**  
You might think it’s just a simple Q&A platform, 
- but it has many **interesting features** that we will explore today. 
- Let’s dive in!  

The structure of the design includes four main parts:  
  1. **Introduction**  
     - Preparing information for the design.  
     - Finding references.  
     - Asking clarifying questions.  
  2. **Architecture**  
     - High-level architecture.  
     - Data model.  
     - Core technologies (e.g., **real-time updates**).  
  3. **Domain-specific topics**  
     - Search, text editor, etc.  
  4. **Common topics for web applications**  
     - **Security**, **performance**, **accessibility**, and others.

---

### **References and Unique Features**  
- Example references: **Quora**, **other Q&A sites**.  
- What distinguishes Stack Overflow?  
  - **Focus on code** as a core feature.  

---

### **Initial Clarifications**  
- Which features should we focus on?  
  - **Feed**, **post creation**, **post search**, **likes**, and **subscriptions**.  
- **Notifications**:  
  - Through browser, email, or on-page.  
- **Offline support?**  
  - **No need** for offline mode.  
- **Mobile app or responsive web design?**  
  - The site should work on **all devices**, no mobile app for now.  
- **User roles?**  
  - Two roles: **normal user** and **moderator** (moderator functions out of scope for now).  
- **Text editor requirements?**  
  - Support for:  
    - **Basic formatting**, **code blocks**, and **images** (no file attachments).  

---

### **Functional vs Non-Functional Requirements**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Feed**: Display posts with sorting options.  
  - **Search**: Users can search posts with parameters.  
  - **Post Creation**: Users can ask questions.  
  - **Comments**: Users can answer or comment on questions.  
  - **Votes**: Users can like or dislike posts and comments.  

- **Non-Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Real-time updates**.  
  - **Device adaptation**: Responsive design.  
  - **Performance**: Fast and smooth.  
  - **Accessibility**: For users with disabilities.  
  - **Security**: Mitigate vulnerabilities.  
  - **Localization**: Support multiple languages.  

---

### **High-Level Architecture**  
We will use the **MVC pattern** (**Model-View-Controller**) for the architecture.  

#### **Technologies**:  
- **WebSockets** for real-time updates.  
- **CDN**: For faster delivery of static files.  
- **Relational DB**: Due to closely coupled entities.  

---

#### **Components**  
- **View**: Responsible for the user interface:  
  - **Feed Page**: Displays posts (default view).  
  - **Post Page**: Shows individual posts and discussions.  
  - **New Post Page**: Includes the **text editor** for creating posts.  

- **Controller**: Handles **business logic**:  
  - User events (e.g., clicks, keyboard inputs).  
  - Saving and polling post drafts.  
  - Updating data in real-time.  

- **Model**: Includes:  
  - **REST API Model**: Handles network operations.  
  - **WebSocket Model**: Manages WebSocket connections.  
  - **Notification Model**: Handles notifications.  

---

### **Rendering Approaches**  

- **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**:  
  - Pros: Easy to develop, smooth transitions.  
  - Cons: Poor SEO, slow initial load.  

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**:  
  - Pros: Great SEO, fast initial load.  
  - Cons: Slow transitions, harder to maintain.  

#### **Proposed Solution**:  
- Use **CSR + Pre-rendering** for a balance of **SEO** and **smooth transitions**.  

---

### **Data Model**  

- **Post**:  
  - Fields: Author, tags, comments, likes/dislikes.  
- **User**:  
  - Fields: Role (user/moderator), liked/disliked posts, info fields.  
- **Tag**:  
  - Fields: Tag name, associated posts.  
- **Comment**:  
  - Fields: Comments/answers, likes/dislikes.  

---

### **Pagination**  

- **Types**:  
  - **Cursor-Based**: For feeds (infinite scrolling).  
  - **Offset-Based**: For search results and comments.  

---

### **API Design**  

- Use **versioning** for API endpoints:  
  - Prefer versioning in **HTTP headers** over the URL.  

---

### **Real-Time Updates**  

- Use **WebSockets**:  
  - Pros: Bi-directional communication, better browser support, developer familiarity.  
  - Alternatives:  
    - **Short Polling**: Inefficient, high overhead.  
    - **Long Polling**: Improved but still suboptimal.  
    - **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: Limited browser support.  

---

### Structured Transcription for Video Content

---

  - Importance of advanced search for Q&A sites: Simple search by post title isn't effective.
  - Solution: Integrate a search template into the search input to provide more flexibility.
  - Example: Typing `[author: John Doe]` in the search input retrieves posts authored by John Doe. Square bracket syntax will be parsed server-side to filter results.
  - Though initially challenging, this method becomes intuitive and faster with practice, especially for a programmer-centric audience.
  - Add a tips panel to guide users in using advanced search functionality.

---

#### **Text Editor Features**
  - Basic formatting: Bold, italic, underline, code blocks, lists, links, and images.
  - **Text formats to consider**:
    1. **HTML**:  
       - Common and straightforward to implement.
       - Advantages: No need for preview mode; flexible and feature-rich.
       - Disadvantages: Deprecated `execCommand`, browser inconsistencies, high maintenance, and complexity.
    2. **Markdown**:  
       - Developer-friendly, portable, and easy to read/write.
       - Advantages: Simplicity, familiarity, and cross-platform compatibility.
       - Disadvantages: Requires a preview mode, has a learning curve, and lacks advanced formatting.
    3. **CommonMark**:  
       - Standardized Markdown variant with fewer ambiguities.
       - Advantages: Extensibility, compatibility with Markdown parsers, and support for custom syntax.
       - Disadvantages: Inherits Markdown limitations, slightly more complex, less widespread.

---

#### **Workflow for CommonMark-Based Editor**
  1. User edits text using CommonMark.
  2. CommonMark text is converted to sanitized HTML via a parser.
  3. Preview mode displays the sanitized HTML.
  4. Published content is saved in the database (both raw CommonMark and HTML versions).
  5. Images:
     - Stored via third-party hosting (e.g., Imgur) for simplicity.
     - Considerations include cost-effectiveness and reduced maintenance.

---

#### **Drafts and Autosave**
  - Drafts prevent loss of progress due to interruptions.
  - Autosave every 10–60 seconds to balance server load and minimize data loss.
  - Store drafts on the server for device-independent access, with a retention period of one week.

---

#### **Notifications**
  - Real-time updates for comments, subscriptions, etc., using push notifications.
  - **Process**:
    1. Push subscription object obtained and stored server-side.
    2. Notifications delivered via a service worker, even when the page is closed.
  - Users can opt for email notifications or disable notifications entirely.

---

#### **Security Measures**
  - **Common vulnerabilities**: XSS and SQL injection.
  - **Sanitization**:
    - Convert CommonMark to HTML and sanitize before saving to the database.
    - Store both raw CommonMark and sanitized HTML for performance optimization.
  - **HTTPS**:
    - Encrypt data in transit.
    - Enable HSTS for secure connections.
  - Implement spam detection, rate limiting, and content security policies.

---

#### **Performance Optimization**
  1. **Network Performance**:
     - Use CDNs with SSL support.
     - Implement HTTP/2, image compression, and lazy loading.
  2. **UI Performance**:
     - Virtualize lists and skeleton loaders.
     - Optimize animations and use scalable icons.
  3. **JavaScript & CSS**:
     - Reduce DOM operations, split bundles, and prioritize lightweight CSS structures.

---

#### **Accessibility**
  - Ensure compatibility with screen readers via semantic HTML, ARIA roles, and alt attributes.
  - Maintain sufficient contrast ratios and large clickable areas.
  - Advanced techniques: Skip-to-content buttons and ARIA live regions for announcements.

---

#### **Localization**
  - Default language: English.
  - Translation via community contributions using the i18next format for simplicity.
  - No internal translation team due to limited resources.

---

#### **Device Adaptation**
  - Optimize for smaller screens using responsive design and touch-friendly elements.
  - Prioritize content over decorative elements on mobile devices.

---

#### **Conclusion**
  - Functional requirements: Advanced search, real-time updates, and a user-friendly text editor.
  - Non-functional requirements: Security, accessibility, localization, and device adaptability.
  - Performance and scalability addressed across the stack.
  - Final words: Thank you for watching! Don't forget to like, subscribe, and stay tuned for more.
