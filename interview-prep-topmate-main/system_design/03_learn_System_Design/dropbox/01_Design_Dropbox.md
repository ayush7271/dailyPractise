  - Future: Support for multiple languages.  

---

## **Step 3: Requirements Gathering**  

### **Functional Requirements:**  
- Users should be able to:  
  - Add, browse, sort, and search files.  
  - Share files with others.  

### **Non-Functional Requirements:**  
- **Accessibility:** Support for users with disabilities.  
- **Performance:** Fast interactions.  
- **Localization:** Multilingual capabilities.  
- **Offline Mode:** Offline access to files.  
- **Security:** Robust file protection.  

---

## **Step 4: High-Level Architecture**  

### **MVC Structure:**  
- **Model:** Divided into:  
  - **Client Store:** Holds mutable, client-specific data (e.g., sorting parameters).  
  - **Responses Cache:** Stores server responses (immutable).  
- **Controller:** Connects the View and Model:  
  - Fetches data from Model/Server.  
  - Handles **view events** and user actions.  
- **View:** UI layer:  
  - Displays data from Controller.  
  - Sends user events back to Controller.  

---

## **Step 5: Backend Components Overview**  

### **Core Components:**  
1. **App Server:**  
   - Handles communication between frontend and backend.  
   - Maintains business logic (e.g., file add/delete).  
2. **Relational Database:**  
   - Stores metadata (e.g., file names, descriptions, owners).  
3. **File Storage:**  
   - Stores binary files.  
4. **CDN Servers:**  
   - Speeds up file delivery by being closer to users globally.  

---

## **Step 6: Component Details**  

### **UI Components:**  
1. **Header:**  
   - Includes search, file addition, and sorting controls.  
2. **Files Section:**  
   - Grid representation of files in:  
     - **Table view (default)**.  
     - **List view**.  
3. **Context Menu:**  
   - Features: Rename, delete, move files/folders.  

---

## **Step 7: Rendering Options**  

### **Approaches:**  
1. **Client-Side Rendering (CSR):**  
   - Suitable for interactive SPAs (e.g., Dropbox, Google Calendar).  
2. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):**  
   - Benefits: Faster initial loading for low-performance devices.  
3. **Hybrid Rendering (Iteration):**  
   - Combines CSR and SSR:  
     - Pre-rendered pages load first.  
     - Interactivity added progressively.  

**Decision:** Use **iteration** for better performance on low-end devices.

---

## **Step 8: Data Model Design**  

### **Entities:**  
1. **File:**  
   - Fields:  
     - **Have Access:** List of user IDs with access.  
     - **Access Requests:** Pending requests.  
     - **Revision Number:** Tracks file versions.  
     - **URL:** Download link.  
2. **Folder:**  
   - Fields:  
     - **Items:** List of files/subfolders.  

---

## **Step 9: Data Manipulation (Client vs. Server)**  

- **Client-Side:**  
  - Pros: High flexibility, quick feature additions.  
  - Cons: Poor scalability for large datasets.  

- **Server-Side:**  
  - Pros: High scalability and performance.  
  - Cons: Higher costs, requires backend coordination.  

**Decision:** Perform data manipulations on the **server-side** for scalability.

---

## **Step 10: Key API Considerations**  

### **Uploading Files:**  
1. **Check if File Exists:**  
   - Options: Replace, keep both, or cancel upload.  
2. **Resumable Uploads:**  
   - File ID helps resume from interrupted byte.  
3. **Threshold:**  
   - Implement for files >10MB in poor network areas.

### **Downloading Files:**  
1. **Process:**  
   - Retrieve file path from metadata in DB.  
   - Fetch file from storage.

### **Sharing Files:**  
1. **Endpoints:**  
   - Separate for files and folders.  
2. **Access Rights:**  
   - Read-only for simplicity (avoid concurrency issues).  
3. **API for Revoking Access:**  
   - Options: Separate endpoint or unified with a revoke variable.

### Security

#### **File Encryption and Decryption**
- Protecting files against storage breaches:
  - **Encryption**:
    - Client sends a file to the server.
    - Server encrypts the file using a **Data Encryption Model** before storing it.
  - **Decryption**:
    - Client requests a file.
    - Encrypted file is decrypted by the server before being sent to the client.

#### **File Transfer Security**
-  Concerns about file theft during transfer:
  - Avoid **client-side encryption** due to:
    - Easier vulnerability to hacking.
    - Inconsistent encryption logic across platforms.
    - High resource consumption.
  - Use **four security pillars**:
    - Encryption.
    - Secure transmission protocols (e.g., HTTPS).
    - Prevent unauthorized access.
    - Test for vulnerabilities.

#### **Preventing Vulnerabilities**
- Regular practices for maintaining security:
  - **Sandboxing**:
    - Isolate files during scanning to prevent malware from affecting the system.
  - **Antivirus scanning**:
    - Regularly scan the main storage for malware.
  - **User education**:
    - Provide clear guidelines on risks and security best practices.

### File Synchronization

#### **Methods**
- Three possible options:
  - **Visibility Change Event**:
    - Triggered when a user changes browser tabs.
    - Limitation: Ineffective for multiple devices.
  - **Polling (Short/Long)**:
    - Server checks for updates at intervals.
    - Not efficient for rare events like file updates.
  - **Server-Side Events (Recommended)**:
    - Uses HTTP protocol.
    - Efficient for infrequent updates.
    - Handles synchronization across instances effectively.

---

### Offline Mode

#### **Features**
- Offline capabilities:
  - Mark files as available offline.
  - Browse/download files without an internet connection.
  - Service Workers enable offline interface functionality.

#### **Implementation**
- Cache assets using **Service Workers** and **Cache API**:
  - Intercept and redirect failed requests to cached files.
- **IndexedDB**:
  - Stores files with high capacity and binary support.
  - For instance, Chrome allows up to 60% of disk space for storage.

---

### Localization

#### **Key Considerations**
-  Supporting international users:
  - Auto-detect user language via:
    - HTTP `Accept-Language` header.
    - IP-based detection.
  - Manual language change option.
  - Address **Right-to-Left (RTL)** languages:
    - Adjust text direction and element positioning.
    - Resize fonts for smaller, complex glyphs.

#### **Translation Formats**
- **JSON**:
  - Human-readable and widely supported.
  - Preferred over ICU for simplicity.

---

### Performance

#### **Network Performance**
- Optimization techniques:
  - Use **CDNs** for reduced latency.
  - Enable **server-side rendering** for static pages.
  - Implement caching for assets via Service Workers.

#### **UI Performance**
- Use **lazy loading** for non-essential elements like pop-ups and analytics scripts.
- **Skeleton screens** improve perceived loading times.
- **Infinite Lists**:
  - Efficient rendering for long lists of files.
  - Replace pagination with dynamic file loading.

---


### General Security Recommendations

#### **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- Mitigation strategies:
  - Sanitize user input before server transmission.
  - Avoid unsafe DOM methods (e.g., `innerHTML`).
  - Use **Content Security Policy (CSP)** and **Trusted Types**.

#### **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
- Prevent unauthorized actions:
  - Use `SameSite` cookie attribute.
  - Implement **CSRF tokens** for robust protection.
  - Utilize `Origin` and `Referer` headers where possible.

#### **Clickjacking**
- Prevent iframe-based attacks:
  - Set **X-Frame-Options** header to restrict iframe usage.

---

### Closing Remarks

#### Summary
- Addressed essential operations (e.g., adding, sharing, synchronizing files).
- Non-functional requirements:
  - **Accessibility**: Semantic elements and ARIA attributes.
  - **Localization**: Multi-language support, including RTL considerations.
  - **Offline Support**: IndexedDB and Service Workers.
  - **Security**: Encryption, sandboxing, and CSRF/XSS prevention.
