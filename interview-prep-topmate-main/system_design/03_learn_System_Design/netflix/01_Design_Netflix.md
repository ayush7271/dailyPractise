---

## **High-Level Architecture**  

### **Client-Side Components**  
1. **View Layer (UI)**:  
   - Components:  
     - Main Page  
     - Search Bar  
     - Player  
   - Handles **UI rendering**.  
2. **Controller**:  
   - Manages **user events** (typing, clicks).  
   - Acts as a proxy between the **model** and **view**.  
3. **Model/Storage**:  
   - Manages data:  
     - **Client state**: Dynamic, session-dependent data.  
     - **Responses**: Immutable, cached data.  

### **Server Assumptions**  
- **App Server**:  
  - Handles all backend requests.  
  - Assumed to exist and function correctly.

---

## **Rendering Approaches**  

### **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**  
- **Advantages**:  
  - Smooth transitions between pages.  
  - Easy to develop.  
- **Disadvantages**:  
  - Slower time-to-interactive on low-performance devices.  
  - SEO challenges.

### **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**  
- **Advantages**:  
  - Faster initial loading.  
  - Better SEO compatibility.  
- **Disadvantages**:  
  - Higher development costs.  
  - Slower page transitions.

### **Hydration**  
- Combines CSR and SSR:  
  - **Initial HTML**: Rendered server-side.  
  - **Interactive Elements**: Added with JavaScript.  
- **Pros**:  
  - Faster initial load.  
  - Smooth transitions.  
- **Cons**:  
  - Potential delay before interactivity is available.

## **API Design**  

### **REST API**  
- **Advantages**:  
  - Flexible, widely adopted.  
- **Disadvantages**:  
  - May require multiple endpoints for varied client needs.  

### **GraphQL**  
- **Advantages**:  
  - Single endpoint supports varied data needs.  
  - Reduces server load and improves performance.  
- **Use Case**:  
  - Fetch different field sets for various clients.  

### **Recommended Approach**  
- **Hybrid**:  
  - REST API for authentication and video streaming.  
  - GraphQL for flexible data fetching.

## **Video Delivery**  

### **Progressive Downloading vs Streaming**  
- **Progressive Downloading**:  
  - Default HTML5 video method.  
  - **Advantages**:  
    - Easy to implement.  
  - **Disadvantages**:  
    - Limited security.  
    - No fast-seeking support.  
- **Streaming**:  
  - Video streamed directly to users.  
  - **Advantages**:  
    - Secure.  
    - Adaptive bitrate streaming supported.  
  - **Disadvantages**:  
    - Harder to develop and maintain.

### **Streaming Protocols**  
- **HLS**:  
  - Widely supported by browsers.  
- **MPEG-DASH**:  
  - Codec agnostic but less supported.  
- **Recommendation**:  
  - Support both HLS and MPEG-DASH for maximum compatibility.  

---

## **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABR)**  
- Dynamically adjusts:  
  - Bitrate  
  - Resolution  
  - Other video parameters  
- Ensures smooth playback by responding to network conditions.  

- **Advantages:**
  - Provides a smooth experience by adapting video quality to user network conditions.
  - Ensures smooth playback.
  - Offers fast start time.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - Harder to implement.
  - Increases costs due to the need to store and deliver multiple representations of a video.

# Offline Mode
### **Features of Offline Mode:**
- Users can download videos to watch offline.
- Interface accessible without an internet connection.
- Prompt users to navigate to the "Downloaded" section when offline.
- Display current network status.

### **Questions and Answers:**
1. **How to protect videos from theft?**
   - Store videos on the user's device with encryption.
   - Use **Encrypted Media Extensions (EME):**
     - EME calls **Content Decryption Module (CDM)** built into browsers.
     - CDM requests a license key from a DRM (Digital Rights Management) server.
     - The license key decrypts the video content for playback.

2. **What features should be available offline?**
   - Service Workers to handle network states and cache responses.
   - Store static files in **Cache API** and meta content in **IndexedDB**:
     - **Why not Local Storage?**
       - Small capacity.
       - Doesnâ€™t support binary files.
       - Synchronous and slow API.

3. **How much video can users upload?**
   - Based on browser storage capacity.
   - Assume an average file size of **500 MB to 10 GB**.
   - Default allocation: **100 GB** (enough for several movies/episodes).
   - Allow users to adjust storage limits.

# Progressive Web Applications (PWA)
### **What is a PWA?**
- Applications built with web technologies.
- Works online and offline.
- Installable with a standalone icon.
- Functions like a browser tab outside the browser.

### **PWA Requirements:**
1. **HTTPS** for secure connections.
2. **Service Workers** for offline functionality.
3. **Web Manifest** to provide site information.

### **Limitations:**
- Browser support varies:
  - Safari for iOS and iPadOS.
  - Chrome for macOS.

---

# Internationalization and Localization
### **Definitions:**
- **Internationalization:** Adapting applications for different languages and regions.
- **Localization:** Cultural adaptations for specific regions.

### **Important Considerations:**
- Support multiple languages, including right-to-left (RTL) scripts like Arabic.
- Implement a **Translation Management System (TMS)** if a dedicated translation team is unavailable.

### **General Recommendations:**
- Predict user language preferences.
- Adjust text direction and formatting for RTL languages.
- Avoid string concatenation and text in images.
- Use logical properties like `margin-inline-start` instead of directional properties.

### **Translation Format Options:**
1. **JSON:** Easy to read/write and supported by most TMS.
2. **ICU:** More powerful but less flexible.
3. **Gettext:** Good TMS support but less versatile.

---

# Accessibility
### **Best Practices:**
- Use semantic tags and ARIA attributes when necessary.
- Add `alt` attributes for images.
- Mark decorative elements with `role="presentation"`.
- Ensure interactive elements are keyboard and touch-friendly.

---

# Device Support and Performance
### **Optimization Tips:**
- Optimize images for smaller screens.
- Add focus events alongside hover events.
- Prioritize main content on small screens.
- Avoid heavy animations and aggressive preloading.

### **Carousel Data Loading:**
- Use **cursor-based pagination** instead of preloading all data.

---

# Security
### **Key Vulnerabilities to Address:**
1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Prevent injection attacks.
2. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Secure forms and sessions.
3. **Clickjacking:** Use framebusting techniques.
4. **HTTPS:** Encrypt all communication.

---

# High-Level Design Overview
### **System Components:**
- **Auth API** and **GraphQL API** for managing queries.
- **Response Cache** for storing responses and meta files.
  - Use **IndexedDB** for persistent storage.
- **Service Workers** for offline functionality.
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN):**  
  - Stores media files and assets for minimal latency.

### **DRM Integration:**
- Video content encrypted and decrypted via DRM servers.
- Offline playback supported with persistent licenses (valid for limited durations).

---

# Conclusion
### **Features Covered:**
- Wide device support with optimized video and image quality.
- Localization and RTL language support.
- Secure against common vulnerabilities.
- Encrypted video content for protection.
- PWA support as a lightweight alternative to native apps.
