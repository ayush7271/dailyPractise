## Monitor your web application

- The goal is to <ins>**move the monitoring activities earlier**</ins> in the development process 
  - to identify and fix problems sooner, 
  - rather than discovering them later, 
<br/>

- There are some tools in which we can easily create a CI integration during the build process.
<br/>

**For example**: 
  - We can **leverage a full WebPageTest Integration** 
    - for both its performance and security insights <ins>by triggering an API call upon a successful website deployment to run an end-to-end build.</ins>
  - We can use command-line tools such as Check My headers to validate that server responses.
